***Welcome to The Super Tiny Compiler (Python Version)!***

This is a Python port of [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler), an ultra-simplified example of all the major pieces of a modern compiler written in easy-to-read JavaScript by [Jamie Kyle](https://github.com/jamiebuilds).

Reading through the guided code will help you learn about how *most* compilers work from end to end.

## Acknowledgements

This project is a Python port of the original [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler) by [Jamie Kyle](https://github.com/jamiebuilds). The original JavaScript version is an excellent resource for learning about the core concepts of compiler design.
